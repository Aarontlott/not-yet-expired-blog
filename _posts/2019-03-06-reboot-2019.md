Well, hello there.

Where the heck have I been? Where did I go? Do I have a plan for 2019 for making some content?

In short, yes. Plans pretty much never go according to… plan, do they? But hey ho that’s life for most of us.

## What’s the plan for 2019 and onwards

As you’ll read below in ‘What the heck happened’, things were a bit hectic but they’re looking up now. And in that I’d like to really begin creating again. Not just videos, not just about games, but creating nonetheless. I’ve added a section to the website, the [Stories](https://www.notyetexpired.com/about-stories/) area.

I’ll settle into a rhythm with how often to post so I can’t really comment on how often, at least not yet. It’s my intention to begin publishing short stories on this blog, and some posts talking about the creative process. It’s been an incredible experience to really work through the details of my sci fi novel and I hope I have some interesting things to share about it. And of course I’d love to share some of the backstory of the universe I’ve been crafting! Some of those mentioned short stories will feature in that universe and I’m really excited about that.

As I settle into the new routine of this year I’ll see if I can continue to make games videos. I’ve had precious little time to actually play video games so, naturally, there’s been a shortage of accompanying video footage to comment on. I so enjoyed getting to make the accessible content, especially of MudRunner, but I do want to commit to doing that.

That stuff above seems like a good place to start for now. If by a miracle I get more time I have some more fun things to think about doing and releasing.

## Side note: Site name change

As a small aside I’ve changed the name of the site at large, at least the title that’s around, from **Yesterdays Games** to **Not Yet Expired.**

This is to more accurately reflect the varied type of content we want to make, and to show that **Yesterdays Games** is a brand within the larger umbrella of **Not Yet Expired**.

## What happened this last (counting) 9 months?

Geez yeah, I was gone just out of the blue. I think on Facebook I posted a “Moving, here watch this” and disappeared for a long while. Well, I’ve spend the last ~9ish months working remotely with a Philly based company and it took a bunch of my time and mental energy. I couldn’t imagine doing even more on top of that. And winter in Scotland is rough with the darkness.

I also spent the little time I had to (nearly now) finish a novel, which I hope to get to announce more on going forward.

> So things seem more hopeful for me, at least from my perspective.

If you’re along for the ride I’m grateful, I hope to have some creative things on here and around. It’s really where I enjoy putting my time and effort.

Best wishes,  
Aaron
