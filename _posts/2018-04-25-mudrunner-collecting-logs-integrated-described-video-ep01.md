Join Aaron as he plays Mudrunner, a game about trucking in the Ural mountains.

This is also my first video made for an accessible audience, using a technique called “Integrated Described Video”; this means I will be trying to describe what’s going on on-screen as it happens, allowing for viewers that are visually impaired (or just otherwise occupied, eg cooking) to follow along.

This is my first video of this type, I would absolutely appreciate any and all feedback on it. Thank you!
