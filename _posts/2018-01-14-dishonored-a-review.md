A spectacular sequel has come out for this gem from 2012, so let’s take a look at the original Dishonored.

You take the role or Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress. I don’t think it’s spoiling too much to say that you’re betrayed and framed for her death. You decide how to proceed and act in light of that in an interesting take on a late 19th century London.

## Choices!

Now, there’s spoilers below, which I know seems like an odd thing for a game that’s been out this long. But I didn’t know anything about Dishonored going into it, so if you find yourself in that boat too, [skip to the Summary](#summary). Onwards!

While it’s not quite Skyrim levels of choice, you play an existing character, you have a big role in how the story progresses. Your lethality, or lack thereof, will change the way certain characters relate to you and what the eventual outcome of the game is.

In an interview with [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/dishonored-co-director-its-ok-for-games-to-be-mean-to-1726981392), Raphael Colantonio, a co-creative director and founder of Arkane Studios, says “and I made the decision, near the end of the project, if you played very, very darkly—you not only killed to get to your goal, but you also went out of your way to kill the maids and everybody else, then at the very end of the game, Samuel Beechworth, the old man who’s been driving your boat around, he basically says, ‘I despise you for what you’ve become.’ And he pulls a flare gun out, and he fires it, and he says, ‘That’s why I’m warning them that you’re coming.’ He betrays you. And we got so much pressure to cut that from the game.”

> Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody—you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars—you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero.
>
> We decided that sounds psychotic.  
> _-Raphael Colantonio_

I love the guts it takes to do that to players. It emphasizes that, yes, you can play however you’d like but that has consequences. Just because you have all these ways to kill people doesn’t mean that you should. It really brings the world to life because it’s not the typical game universe, applauding and rewarding you no matter what your behavior is.

When I started playing my first time, I had none of this context. I didn’t know there was a system that did this in the game, and after breaking my way out of prison on the first level I killed my way through the guards. No big deal right? Well escaping into the next level you’re passed by a couple of guards and they’re talking about how you murdered your way through them, and that you _must_ be guilty of killing your beloved empress, seeing as how easily you took their lives.

Wow. To be honest, I didn’t want that, and I reloaded a save to start over. Corvo felt real, his situation felt realistic and honest.

## How does it feel to be Corvo?

Dishonored is a FPS, with natural feeling controls and mechanics, and if you do decide you need to spill some blood then there’s a myriad of ways to do so. But it also has solid stealth mechanics, and a novel way to let you know if a guard is noticing you.

The city of Dunwall feels gritty, dirty and believable. Researching for this article I found that they had based it off of a 18th-19th century London / Edinburgh, and having lived near to Edinburgh I can attest to the feel of the cities being excellent. For me, the fictional city of Dunwall evokes the feel you get winding through the cramped closes of the Edinburgh royal mile.

The choice system makes the story come alive though, even if the storyline isn’t winning any awards. It feels like your choices matter, and the characters respond to how you choose to complete your missions. A later mission has you eliminating the two Pendleton twins, you are working for their brother Trevor. The one on your side has obvious hesitations about ordering the killing of his brothers, but goes along with it. I won’t spoil the non-lethal solution, but Trevor comes back to you after a later mission and thanks you for not killing them in a heartfelt way.

> Basically a “I know they’re evil, but their still my brothers. Thank you for not killing them.”

I was honestly able to connect with the character and the way I played through the game because of this. I spent a lot of time, and reloading saves, to beat the game with the non-lethal achievement, and last was working towards a never detected or had alarms raised playthrough. It’s left me in a strange position that I’m actually a bit appalled if I kill anyone in the game, even though there’s clearly been a lot of work put into the methods of doing so.

## Let’s talk technical for a minute

Dishonored was released October 9th, 2012, and is still a nice looking game. The art style lends itself well to aging gracefully. My laptop is pretty decent, but running the game on my integrated Intel HD 4600 I can get playable framerates (40+) at 1280×768 w/ MLAA, all else set to the lowest settings. For me it’s always been about how the games plays, the interaction with characters and the like, so having the graphics not be perfect is totally fine. Dishonored is still very much worth it in my book if you can get some playable framerates from it.

<div id="summary"></div>So if you have any of the integrated graphics that are newer than my built-in one, you should be able to run Dishonored appreciably well.

## Summary

Dishonored is a compelling story, with good gameplay mechanics and a low enough barrier of entry in price and system requirements that it should be one the single player games you add to your collection. I went into it knowing precisely nothing about the gameplay or story, and I would advise anyone also in that position to jump in and enjoy the ride. I know I grew to really like Corvo and his struggle by the end of it, I hope you do too.

I’ll soon begin posting the a playthrough where I attempt to beat Dishonored without killing anyone or being detected, until then take care!
