## A workplace anywhere

You work in an open plan office. It’s trying to be trendy: iMac’s everywhere, minimal cords on the desks, a sprawling mural across an entire wall. But the low ceilings made from those cheesy tiles–the ones that contractors never seem to put back in correctly–betray its façade. You can see three askew from your desk, giving you a view into the dark rafters.

It’s about 12:45; time for lunch. The later break makes the day go by quicker. You get up and walk over to the kitchen area where there’s a tiny sink and a microwave. In another life, the tiny machine would have been happy with just reheating meals in a family RV a few times a year. It was overtaxed with the 20+ people using it. And dirty. *Glad I have a soup-like thing, and a glass container! No plastic-cancer for me*.

You punch ‘time cook’, 1 and then 3 – 0. You like to stir the chili partway through to get it nice and warm throughout. You stand, watching the numbers tick down and thinking about how ‘they’ said you weren’t supposed to be too close to the microwave. You feel yourself get heavier. It’s an odd sensation all over your body. Your muscles began to clench, but not painfully so. Not yet.

“I must be too close to the microwave…” you mumble, taking a teetering step back. What an odd thing to happen.

> 45 seconds left.

Shooting pain in your left arm and you look down to it, massaging the wrist with your other hand. *Oh my god, am I having a heart attack? I’m too young for this*.

You struggle to keep in a scream, wondering if you’re losing your mind or having some kind of seizure. And that’s when your left hand amps up a few notches in pain and claws jut out of the ends of your fingers with a sound like slicing meat. There’s a light pitter-patter as blood drips off of your hand onto the floor. You see one of your fingernails ping off the microwave.

> 30 seconds to go.

The arm pain migrates to the rest of you. The sensation of getting heavier intensifies and travels to your other arm and your legs. The slopping sound of blood and bits of your skin, along with a relatively quiet ripping of your clothes, and you are still somehow convinced this is a sick daydream or some kind of psychotic episode.

*I really must be going crazy.* You don’t dare look down because of what you might see. That you might *actually* be changing. Your perspective begins to change, you are getting taller.

> 20 seconds left.

The pain is incredible. You feel the sensation of your head squeezing its way out of your old head. One of your coworkers, a woman you hardly speak with, rounds the corner and confirms with a bloodcurdling scream that, yes, something was wrong, and, no, it isn’t all in your head.

You open your mouth to offer some kind of apology, some plea for help, some explanation for what was happening. What echoes from your mouth is not a scream but the deafening roar of a monster.

You turn and run. Something on top of your now-huge back–a spine, perhaps?– snags and then pulls free from the ceiling tiles. Water pours down and you realize you must have hit a fire sprinkler. *Good.* It would serve as cover for your escape as you now feel a strong urge to leave this place and quickly.

The door was one of those fire doors that you would usually have to push for some time for it to open, but your arms–your claws–tear it from its hinges easily and you push through, crouching down and into the rainy day.

*What if this had happened on a nice day? Would I have gotten away so cleanly?* But you don’t have time to think, just time to turn and run.

Into the industrial estate.

Through a chain-link fence.

Into the drainage canal.

Faintly, as if you’re only hearing it in the back of your mind, the microwave beeps its completion of the chili that you’ll never get to eat.

*What will my wife think?* The dismay that’s now washing over you is crippling. You scream at the thought that you’ll probably never see her again. But your scream comes out as a roar and number of birds take flight at the deafening sound of your voice.

You run.
