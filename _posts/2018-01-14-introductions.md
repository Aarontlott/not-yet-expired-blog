Hello there and welcome to Yesterdays Games!

If you want to learn a bit more about who we are, and what Yesterdays is, check out our About page.

The short version is this: We want to release entertaining, informative, and accessible videos/articles about video games. Our focus is on games that may have graced the center stage a while ago, but are still worth your time. Indy games that’ll run on modest hardware. Games that will maximize the time and money you choose to invest in them.

> Games that, in our opinion, are not yet expired.

We want to post at least **2 times a week**, and we’ll be uploading our videos to the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCduApf64cY37XiBSpFTDeMQ/) and onto our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NotYetExpired/); hopefully this will help make it simple enough to enjoy our content no matter what platform you prefer. There will be notifications of this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AaronYesterdays), and if you Like/Subscribe on the requisite platforms.

I’m excited to get this thing going! I’ve been a longtime consumer of gaming videos on YouTube, and I’m looking forward to giving back to that community and creating something of value with the time I spend playing games as well. I sincerely hope you find something you like here over the next weeks and months.

Best,  
Aaron
