Join Aaron as he continues building his transportation empire. With the coal line securing a nice stable income, and a couple of cities are connected, it’s time to decide what to do next: freight or passengers?

Before we go too much further, we’ll need to decide upon how we’re going to grow our cities. It’s important to have passenger or goods service to the cities, but without a little planning we’ll run into some trouble. And of course, the traffic on our rails will increase tremendously, so some more advanced junctions will be in order!

## Passengers or goods?

There’s a number of people who prefer to play OpenTTD and either focus on Freight transport, or Passenger transport, and others yet that want to do both. I typically fall into the latter group, but it’s important to give careful thought to the amount of train traffic on your rails once you start adding in more cargos to the rails. While both passengers and freight require trains, the schedules are different enough to cause some interference.

### Passengers

Passenger transport is all about frequency, and it makes sense. In order to have good ratings you need to have consistent train service to the stations, even if you’re not transporting a full load of passengers. And people don’t want to be waiting ages to get to their destination, so you’ll be typically having shorter trains, with faster engines, than freight.

So all these shorter, faster trains can work well enough with your tracks and junctions, but when you start adding long, slow freight trains (just by virtue of hauling tons and tons of cargo), it can lead to some congestion and your passenger trains bunching up and throwing off your timetables.

### Freight

Freight transport is much more relaxed when it comes to frequency, but they don’t want their goods just sitting out in the elements and not making them money either. So, due to the fairly straightforward nature of freight, ie. one station supplies just one other industry, or is supplied by multiple industries, you can have trains wait for full load. I typically have enough trains on the station to ensure there’s one always waiting to fill while the other is finishing loading.

Freight trains (in my experience) nearly always make buckets of money, so cloning a few out will always pay off long term, as your ratings will remain high and the industry will continue to grow.

## Train tracks

So, we have freight with it’s less frequent, slow-long trains, and the frequent short-fast passenger trains. If we put these on the same tracks, as I did so often when I was first playing the game, it’s a long term nightmare. And it’s typically your passenger lines that get messed up, because they care a lot more about frequency and they’ll be having constant battles for track room with your slower freight traffic. So if your a bit cash poor when you start your freight lines, it’s okay to have mixed tracks, but you’ll want to segregate your traffic pretty soon if you can.

With freight traffic, we can probably use these simple junctions for longer, as because we’ll have trains leaving their stations only when they’re full (to maximize cargo / money for the load, and to minimize train traffic).

On the other hand, with passenger traffic, we’ll have a lot more trains out on our tracks, so we’re going to need some junctions that will support that constant traffic. Of course, these will make sure our freight lines can expand substantially without worrying about the train limit of the simpler junctions.

If you want to do both passenger and freight, I’d recommend building separate tracks (perhaps linking the stations, but having the entrance and exit be separate). For the purpose of showing you all this, I’ll be doing both!

## Advanced junctions

Let’s head over to the wiki and pick out a nice advanced junction! As you’ll see, there’s a lot of options. I’m a fan of this one, [Over Under Junction](https://wiki.openttd.org/Over_Under_Junction), because it’s efficient, and is fairly straightforward to build. I find it a little tedious to build the complex junctions, but stick with it and you’ll be rewarded handsomely for your effort! As with many of these junctions, they do require a lot of space (although there is a cute compact version on the wiki).

There’s really no easy way of laying these out, but I recommend either enabling “building when paused” or working on a junction that’s not in use. The first few times you build a fancy junction it’ll just take some time, so ease in and make sure you build it right. A tablet might be helpful, or a second monitor, or your cell phone, or heck, even print out a picture of it; all good ways to guide you along.

When you’re done, you’ll have something that looks (and hopefully) functions great!

## Connect your industries

Now that you have some tracks worthy of some serious train traffic, connect your industries. My go to for an easy start is **Forestry** to **Sawmill**, and the send the **Goods** to any city station that accepts them. It’s a fairly straightforward exchange, and makes some kind of sense in my mind; furniture, or some other wooden goods?

You can explore the other industries by clicking on them and checking the **display chain** button, this will show you where those goods need to be transported in order to be turned into goods. If you enjoy freight transport, then some of the mods/GFRs might be of interest to you, as several drastically overhaul the industries, adding many and making the supply chains much more interesting. Check out the website for [FIRS](https://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs/releases/LATEST/docs/html/economies.html) for a peek at this, 68 cargos and 83 new industries! If you feel bored of the base industry, or city gameplay, and want to step it up, let me know how you get on.

### Once you get your first industry

Now that you’re connected, and delivering the sweet cargo to your cities/towns, and your train line is balanced (enough trains and such), do another. If you’re doing **Forestry -&gt; Sawmill** like I do, connect another Forest to the mill, it’ll take as much as you can throw at it and transport away, so make sure you have enough goods trains to take up the slack when it comes time! But continue connecting industries and growing things.

More often than not I run into issues with my old junctions, and then I have to take some time to upgrade my infrastructure. Not the funnest, but it’s nice when you get the new one flowing really well. I would recommend either turning on **building while paused** when you have to retrofit a junction, or perhaps build a new one adjacent to the old of a better design. I’ve had more than a few spaghetti junctions that I’ve had to go and rebuild later in the game that are now a huge headache. Deal with it earlier if you can, it’ll make your late game a lot easier.

## Passengers

Now let’s work on expanding the passenger lines a bit more. Don’t be afraid to set up more stations in your towns, no reason to shoehorn everything into one station. But before we go too far, our greatest weapon when it comes to taming passenger trains. The timetable! \[cue suspenseful music\]

Full disclaimer, I am no expert with timetables, and often times I end up still with messed up train schedules and such. But I’ll help you the one or two steps up the stairs that I’ve made it.

### Timetables

A best friend, or a worst enemy? A little of both? Probably that last bit. In theory they work by assigning an amount of time a train can spend in transit to it’s stations, and then a hard time of how long it stays to load and unload. So if it’s got extra time in transit, it’ll slow down to keep its timetable. This *should* mean that your trains stay nice and spaced out, consistently picking up and delivering passengers (or cargo).

Functionally they can tend to bunch up, especially if they’re sharing tracks with freight trains. Then you get 3 trains to your other city arriving at the same time, with the first train “on schedule” and the other 2 hopeless behind schedule and rushing out of the station. By making sure we have 1) enough berths at our stations and 2) we have junctions that flow our traffic well. If we don’t overcrowd our tracks, we should be fine.

Set them up from the timetables menu, and use **control+click** to send the orders to multiple trains. I usually do **autofill** and then increase the time by a few days to make sure you have enough time. That’s usually good, but keep an eye on them to make sure.

## What now?

Go forth and create! But no really, these are the basics that I’ve found really helped me make some cool stuff once I knew them. I’d love to see some of what you are making out there, feel free to send screenshots, or a saved game, to me over our Discord or send a link to a video. Really any way to show what you’ve been up to!

After this, I think I’ll get started on a little scenario that should be interesting, stay tuned to see that!
