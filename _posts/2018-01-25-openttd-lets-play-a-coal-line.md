Hello! So today we’re gonna be playing a game from ages ago, and I think you’ll like the retro style graphics. It’s a business simulation game called OpenTTD, the TTD is for it’s inspiration, Transport Tycoon Deluxe.

### Settings to note

There’s lots of settings in OpenTTD, but here’s a few that’ll get you setup well.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-11"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![An image of the settings, 'cargo' is in the search screen and we've made sure to set passengers to 'symmetric' so they have a specific destination.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/settings-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/settings.png "Settings") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-11-283"> We just want to make sure out cargo behaves somewhat realistically. Passengers care where they go, we won’t for mail because it’s a pain, and armored cars just take money and jewels. So it’s all good. </figcaption></figure></div>### Mods used

I don’t run too many mods, they call them GRFs. Mine are below, with a brief description:

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-12"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![An image of the GFR, or mod, settings. Two are enabled: one for alternate image train stations, the other adds a lot of road vehicles.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mod_gfrs-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mod_gfrs.png "Mods – GFR settings") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-12-277"> I’d like to do some more GFRs at some point, but keeping it simple to start with. </figcaption></figure></div>### Generating your map

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-13"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![An image of the world generation settings, 512 by 512 size, very flat terrain type, 1950's start date, and few rivers. All other settings are default.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/map_gen-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/map_gen.png "Map generation settings") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-13-276"> Just some map generation settings, feel free to set how you like! But this is a decent way to start, the maps don’t get too technical. </figcaption></figure></div>Here’s my map settings, if you’d like to generate one like mine. But feel free to try some different settings and see what you like.

### Picking your starting location

With this big map now, where should you begin? A nice way to get some solid easy income is to get a coal -&gt; power plant line running. Because there’s nothing that goes into the coal mines, and no outgoing product from the power plant. It’s a simple pickup-dropoff relationship, and it’ll solidly make you money well into the game.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-14"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A power plant sits on a small hill, a farmland sits to it's north. This is where a budding transport empire will earn it's first dollars.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/powerplant-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/powerplant.png "A lone power plant") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-14-278"> A lone power plant, this is what will kick start your transport empire. </figcaption></figure></div>So, look for a power plant with several coal mines in the area. We want a couple that are at least 70+ tons production. Less than that and it’s a bit slow. If you can find a place with some big cities nearby, all the better, but the coal lines can happily chug along making you money while we later setup passenger service elsewhere.

## Let’s get some trains!

### Tracks

So, first things first, lay some tracks. I like to build in nice straight lines, this’ll make junctions a lot simpler, and all that. You want the tracks to go both ways and to be a little ways from your stations, as this’ll give you some room to get things setup nicely.

### Signals

Now, signals can be a bit confusing, but let’s keep it simple with path signals. We want the **one-way path signals**, with the little red sign on it’s post there. We’ll make use of the normal path signal, but for now just rock the one-way path signal. Pick your directions and control+click and drag the signals out to place them.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-medium" id="gallery-15"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Two tracks run the length of the screen, with semaphore style signals controlling the traffic. There is a farm in the bottom left and farmland dotted around.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/signals-300x169.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/signals.png "One-way path signals") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-15-280"> Your tracks should just look like this, a nice two-way rail-road. </figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Two tracks run the length of the screen, with semaphore style signals controlling the traffic. There is a farm in the bottom left and farmland dotted around. There are arrows indicating the direction.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/signals_direction-arrows-300x169.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/signals_direction-arrows.png "One-way path signals with arrows") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-15-281"> Some arrows showing the way these signals work. The trains keep the signals to their right. </figcaption></figure></div>### Stations

Just starting out we’ll make our coal stations 2-track terminus stations, this’ll make things way easier, and they won’t have a huge amount of traffic through them. Do something like this below and connect it to the mainline.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-16"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A train is parked in a terminus station, with a simple in-out track and connecting to the main line.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/terminus-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/terminus.png "A terminus station") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-16-282"> A simple station, terminus station, for small or simple goods. </figcaption></figure></div>Now for the power plant station, we’ll want something a little more advanced. This’ll be a design that you see me use quite a lot, and I like it. This’ll handle a huge amount of trains, more than our little map will force us to use on this power plant anyways. We’ll run into issues with our junctions before this stations get’s clogged up.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-17"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A power plant has a station to it's left, where trains can pull in and then through, looping around to an exit track paralleling the entry track.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ro-ro_station-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ro-ro_station.png "Power plant with ro-ro station") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-17-279"> A simple enough station to build, you just need a bit of space. It’s nice because you can expand it to the left if you need to, but this’ll handle plenty of trains. </figcaption></figure></div>### Junctions

Speaking of junctions, we’re gonna keep it simple. A junction is where your tracks cross, and in the [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/Junction) you can see some incredible junctions. They can allow a huge amount of train traffic to pass over them without interrupting, but they can be horribly complex to make.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-18"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A really complex junction, it's called a transmogrified aligned junction. Not even sure how to build it much less describe it. But basically there's 4 sets of tracks into it, with two diamond shapes (of track) on the outside and inside, allowing trains to turn left or right without blocking another train. There's bridges involved.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Transmogrified_aligned.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Transmogrified_aligned.png "Transmogrified aligned") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-18-288"> Transmogrified aligned junction. Really fancy, can handle a HUGE amount of traffic… but how do you even begin to make it? </figcaption></figure></div>So we’re keeping it simple. You’ll wanna do your junctions like this. And as you’ll begin to see, they can easily handle the kind of traffic we’ll have on the tracks for a while yet.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-19"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A shot of a simple train track junction, a three way one. There are one-way path signals, in the style of a semaphore, that control the directions.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/junction-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/junction.png "A simple junction leading to the power plant") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-19-275"> Sometimes, all you need is a simple junction. I would argue that most of the time it’s all you need. </figcaption></figure></div>### Depot

Now, we gotta buy some trains and give them orders! Place down a depot in your power plant area (personal preference) and click “New Vehicle”. Grab your engine and add cars till your length is 4 on the right. It might be hard to see, but it should be 7 cars on your train.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail" id="gallery-20"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A close up image of a train depot, it is at the exit of the powerplan ro-ro station, so trains in need of service can get maintenance after unloading.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/depot-150x150.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/depot.png "A depot") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-20-272"> The humble depot, the backbone of your transport empire. Buying, selling, replacing and servicing your trains. </figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![At the powerplant ro-ro station, the depot interface is open, and I'm preparing to buy a steam train. There's a scrollable window that shows all the available engines and cargo wagons.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/new_vehicle-150x150.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/new_vehicle.png "Buying a train") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-20-298"> Buying a train is as easy as a few clicks. Pick your train according to budget (if you must) and distance. More expensive, higher power trains are good if you’re pulling long distance, but can tend to get stopped behind your slower trains. </figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![At the powerplant ro-ro station, two trains are pulling out, while the game interface is open to the depot. A train with 7 coal cars has been purchased, it has a tile length of 4. The engine used was a Kirby Paul Tank, steam engine.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4-length_train-150x150.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/4-length_train.png "Buying a train, 4 length") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-20-297"> If you look to the right of the train in the depot, you’ll see a really tiny number, going up by increments of 0.5 at a time, and because I used a 4 tile length station, I’ll want a 4 tile length train to take full advantage of that. </figcaption></figure></div>Go into the orders and add both the coal mine and power plant. Then make sure you have “Full load any cargo” on the coal mine and then press that bottom bar that now says ‘Stopped’ in red! “Woo woo” your first train will say, as it chugs off into the distance and starts your transport empire.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-21"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![At the powerplant ro-ro station, I've given the train still in the depot orders to go to a coal mine (Wenningpool Falls) and return to the station (Power Plant Station).](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/train_orders-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/train_orders.png "Train orders") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-21-296"> For these trains it’s fairly easy going, full-load of coal, drop it off at the station. The trains know what to do. </figcaption></figure></div>## Now what?

For all your coal mines that are close, you can probably made do with 1 train each. If the production is particularly high or the mine is far away, then you should add another train. You can usually tell you need more trains if there’s coal (or whatever the station produces) left on the station after a train leaves, and the amount of product is increasing.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-22"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A powerplant with a ro-ro station is at the top, with straight line tracks and a simple junction. The tracks lead to a terminus station at the bottom, with a coal mine producing a huge amount of coal.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1st_mine-and-powerplant-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/1st_mine-and-powerplant.png "The first mine and power plant") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-22-271"> A nice start to your rail empire! A productive mine pouring money into your pocket. </figcaption></figure></div>You can clone trains with control+click when you choose to close a vehicle, and this is super important as it creates another train with “Shared Orders”. This means that it’ll already have the orders from the other train and you can send it on it’s way.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-medium" id="gallery-23"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![At the powerplant ro-ro station, a train is pulling in, while the game interface is open for the depot (where you buy and sell trains and cargo wagons), and the clone train button has been pressed.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clone_train-300x169.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clone_train.png "Clone a train") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-23-295"> Cloning is an easy feat in OpenTTD, but it’s really buying the same engine and cars, and copying the orders (or sharing if you click “Ctrl”). </figcaption></figure><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![At the powerplant ro-ro station, a train is pulling in, while the game interface has a little indicator over the mouse that means we can clone (buy an exact copy of that train in a depot), the icon is a stack of two little train engines.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clone_train_click-300x169.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/clone_train_click.png "Cloning a train") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-23-294"> Once you’ve clicked “Clone Train” you can just click on your desired train. Remember to hold “Ctrl” if you want to share the orders. </figcaption></figure></div>**Pro tip:** You can select the last order to end the shared orders if you need the train elsewhere, or maybe cloned the wrong train.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-24"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![The selection window of a train is open, and orders are open. After the two stations listed is an entry for 'End of shared orders', clicking this changes a button to allow to end the shared orders.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/end_shared-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/end_shared.png "How to end shared orders") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-24-273"> Sometimes you need to end shared orders, just choose that last order and click stop sharing. Easy as that! </figcaption></figure></div>Now connect up your coal mines and you’ll have to wait a little bit to start raking in money. I usually start planning out my first passenger line at this point, and start paying off debt. The sooner you’re debt free the sooner all that sweet sweet money will be yours.

<div class="gallery galleryid-237 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-25"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A zoomed out image of two powerplants and four coal mines connected. The train tracks are in straight lines with simple junctions connecting them.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/final_shot-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/final_shot.png "All of our mines and stations") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-25-274"> Our coal empire thus far, showing 4 stations and 2 powerplants. </figcaption></figure></div>- - - - - -

Join us for the next episode where I’ll be setting up several passenger lines and starting to talk about how to make our cities grow.
