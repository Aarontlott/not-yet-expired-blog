Join Aaron as he continues building his transportation empire. With the coal line securing a nice stable income, it’s time to start looking into passenger transport and, along with it, city growth.

So, before we jump into passenger lines, let’s talk briefly about distance. Which may seem odd, but stay with me, in OpenTTD, cargo pays more the further it’s delivered. So on our coal line, we can deliver down to this lower Power plant and from the lower to the upper, to be able to squeeze more money out of it. And just so you don’t have to take my word for it, here’s a picture of the same coal cargo being unloaded at both.

How’s another $10k sound? </figcaption></figure></div>## Passengers

Passengers. They’re a little more fickle than cargo, that’s for sure, and because in the beginning we made sure to have passengers be ‘symmetric’, it means that everyone at a station has a destination. Granted, they’ll only take a train if there’s service somewhere. It’ll make sense when we jump into it.

### A quick note about mail

Passengers and mail come like peas and carrots, so we might as well pick them up at the same time. Any station that supplies passengers will also do so for mail, and same for the drop off. There’s places that don’t, but those towns are so tiny that we wouldn’t yet put in a train line there.

### Passenger stations

Now, our passenger stations are going to have a large amount of traffic, because as the city grows that passengers wanting your train service will as well. Eventually you’re going to need multiple stations to handle some of the larger cities, but a single one to start is perfectly fine. Again, my personal preference for busier stations is the ro-ro station style I used on the power plants, it allows a smaller amount of tracks and stations, while leaving some options for expansion. Go ahead and place one in two cities of your choice; they shouldn’t be too far apart, and they also don’t have to use your coal lines either, that’ll just be thrifty. And trust me, we won’t be having any money issues.

Later, when we get diesel trains, you’ll see some trains that are purpose built for passenger transport, but for now they’re pretty straightforward and not unlike our coal trains. But, our passengers won’t want to be waiting, so let’s make sure we’re picking the fastest (with a decent reliability) train we can. And we’ll want, as I mentioned before, attached some mail cars onto the train as well. For aesthetic reasons I like to put them on the front or rear of the passenger cars.

<div class="gallery galleryid-292 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-28"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![An image of a completed train, steam engine, two mail cars followed by 5 passenger carriages.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/passenger-train-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/passenger-train.png "A complete passenger train") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-28-310"> A completed passenger train, complete with mail cars. </figcaption></figure></div>We’ll give this one orders for the two cities, and it’s away. Now what? Well, you’ll see that the stations for now aren’t generating any passengers. That’s okay because the passengers don’t know there’s a train stopping there yet, and basically won’t until our first train shows up. We can either 1) tell the train to temporarily “Full load any cargo” or 2) Buy another train right now and send it along in the others wake. Long term, it works out to being the same, but if you don’t want to take out additional loan money (and you’re waiting for your coal line to get you enough to pay for another train), then do the full load option. This’ll allow you time to make that money up and not be sending an empty train down the tracks.

All this passenger + mail transport is nice, but does it do anything else? It causes the cities to grow. Clicking on the city name will show you how often the city is growing, and with passenger + mail service, it’ll begin to grow slowly. We can speed this up but also delivering other cargos, but for this episode we’ll stay focused on passengers.

<div class="gallery galleryid-292 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-30"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A window is open showing a city overview: Population is 1,121, there are 31 houses, 33 of 181 passengers, 2 of 36 mail, and the town is growing every 100 days.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/town_growth-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/town_growth.png "Town growth") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-30-315"> Every 100 days may not be that often, but it’s a decent start! </figcaption></figure></div>### Ratings and local authority

This is a great time to mention station ratings and your company reputation with the local authority. If we make sure passengers aren’t waiting at the station for ages and ages, our ratings will be pretty good. This has to do with the frequency and timeliness of our trains at that station. Let’s see our new passenger station vs a coal mine.

<div class="gallery galleryid-292 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-31"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![Two stations are shown, one with very good ratings (69%) and the other, less so with (39%).](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/station_ratings-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/station_ratings.png "Station ratings") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-31-314"> Station ratings can either bolster your booming business, or sink you. You’ll want this to be, obviously, higher. </figcaption></figure></div>Now, if you have good station reputation, and haven’t been bulldozing parts of a town for no reason, your local authority rating should be good. It’s probably great, which is good to hear.

But what if it’s not? They won’t even let you build near the town, and you’re unable to repair that relationship. Sometimes that town controls an industry that you need, or is big enough that you want to have a station there. The answer is park improvement.

<div class="gallery galleryid-292 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-large" id="gallery-32"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![A ro-ro passenger station, and a small town, absolutely surrounded with trees as a way of making the local authorities happier.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/station_1-1024x576.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/station_1.png "Lots of trees") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-32-311"> So, when things go bad, you go green! </figcaption></figure></div>Well, not exactly. But you can plant trees around the town to improve their feelings towards you, at least enough to get a station and tracks down, and then that’ll improve the relationship by having timely transportation. But, this can be expensive! So don’t try this early on, I’d say move on to another city for the time being and repair that later. Although hopefully you haven’t made any enemies this early on in the game!

## Next steps

Start connecting more cities, and setting up lines between them. It may take some finessing, but you’ll get a handle on it after a few. At this point you can probably start paying off your debt, as you should be absolutely raking in money ([Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) would be proud). We’ll be reaching a point where you can now focus expanding your train network and improving your junctions, as we’ll be hitting the limits of the simple junctions pretty quickly.
