Join Aaron as he plays through the ninth level of Dishonored, the final mission of the base game. Heâ€™s going to confront the loyalists at Kingsparrow Island and rescue Emily; all without being detected or killing anyone.

There also happens to be a little surprise montage of the entire game, as apparently you cannot get the achievements for beating the game with no detects/kills from the mission select screen. So, speed-run (ish) time!
