I have *finally* released my novel **The Machina: Refugees of Darterra** on Amazon worldwide. It is with no small dose of trepidation that I put myself out there with this story, but if you take the time to read it, I hope you enjoy it.

You can get to the Amazon page with this link. It’ll redirect to your respective Amazon region for my friends not in the USA. <http://mybook.to/MachinaDarterra>

If you’ve done this before, you’ll know how exciting it is to see your work out there. It made me giddy to find it on Amazon myself!

I really, honestly, want people to review it genuinely– if you think it’s 3 star work, then please say so, but any review helps immensely with getting traction on Amazon.

Thank you for your time!

Best wishes,  
Aaron
