Hello again! It’s been a couple of weeks since the book launch. Which is still very much a **wow** moment. I’ve got some exciting things in the works, and I’ll be sure to share some more about that when I hear more.

So, for now, I wanted to give a wee update.

## Sales

I am so blown away by your generosity, thank you everyone who has bought/downloaded the novel! So far, there have been 20 paid sales, and incredibly, 80 downloads on the free day I ran a couple of Fridays ago. So there’s 100 copies of the novel out there!

To each and every one of you, I hope you enjoy the story.

If you’ve not yet checked it out, it’s available here: <http://mybook.to/MachinaDarterra>

## Review

In this day and age, reviews are the lifeblood of an independent author. I’ve got one review thus far (thanks Ken!), but more would be amazing. Not only will you have my immense gratitude, but it will go leaps and bounds towards generating that momentum that will, perhaps, carry my novel outwards to readers I don’t know personally.

> I want to specifically note that ANY review is worthwhile!

If you felt “meh” about the book, or it wasn’t your cup of tea, a 3-star review will telegraph to a new reader that “this is a real book!” If the choice is between no review or a 3-star, please leave the 3-star. I’m not perfect and I very much welcome the feedback in public on that, and it really helps when building credibility. Would you trust something with 100 5-star reviews or a mixture of reviews?

So, according to the interwebs, and after much Googling, it seems like no one really **knows** how Amazon’s algorithm works. Which makes sense. But there’s some decent milestones and numbers that I came across that mean the book will be ranked better.

### Initial goal is 10 reviews

It seems like the base level of reviews for a stranger to look at a page and say, “Yeah, I’ll give that a look” is 10 reviews. Any less and they feel like they’re taking a risk, and they will likely move on. If we can get there, with your help dear reader, that would be terrific.

### Getting momentum goal is 20 reviews

Apparently, it’s just 20 reviews to get the attention of Amazon’s search algorithm. I feel like that’s really doable with the number of downloads that have happened thus far, and, of course, I would absolutely love that! This is where the book can start to travel outside of my sphere of influence, which is both exciting and terrifying.

## Ok, where can I review the book?

Either on Amazon or on Goodreads would be ideal. If you don’t use Goodreads, then just the plain ol’ Amazon product page would work.

Here it is on Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53669604-the-machina>

And again on Amazon (redirects to your regional Amazon): <http://mybook.to/MachinaDarterra>

## Finally, thank you

Seriously, I am so grateful and humbled by the support I’ve gotten so far. Thank you. If you’ve not gotten a chance to start reading the story, I hope that when you do, you enjoy it.

Best wishes,  
Aaron
