Join Aaron as he plays Mudrunner, a game about trucking in the Ural mountains. He’s getting his trucks setup for the last journey to the saw mill on this map.

This is made using a technique called “Integrated Described Video”; this means I will be trying to describe what’s going on on-screen as it happens, allowing for viewers that are visually impaired (or just otherwise occupied, eg cooking) to follow along.

I absolutely appreciate any and all feedback on it. Thank you!
