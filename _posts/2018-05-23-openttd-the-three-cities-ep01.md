Join Aaron for developing a small map, one dominated by 3 cities! There’s not much room to move, I’ll have to rely on careful planning of my few train tracks and utilize buses/streetcars to do the last mile delivery. A much more micro version of OpenTTD than the typical macro “**11 lane super-train-highways**“.

Hope you enjoy!
