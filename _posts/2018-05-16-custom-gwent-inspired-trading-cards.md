So, as a creative “break from the norm”, I decided to follow one of the many crazy ideas that I have.

So, it starts something like this: Have you ever heard of trading card games? Like **Pokemon**, **Magic the Gathering**, or that kind of thing? Yes? How about **Gwent**?

<div class="gallery galleryid-414 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-medium" id="gallery-34"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![5 Gwent cards; game cards for a mini game in the Witcher 3 game, they have an illustrated picture of a character on the top, and a name and quote on the bottom over a parchment texture, and are tall and skinny.](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gwent_cards-300x169.jpg)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gwent_cards.jpg "gwent_cards") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-34-415"> This is what they look like: a name, caption and some stuff for the game. </figcaption></figure></div>So, not having played the others, but having played gwent a ton while playing through **The Witcher 3**, I had the wild idea to make a set of Gwent cards (which is not news, lots of people printed their own before the official cards came out). But the twist was to use my coworkers as the names on the cards, picking an image that represents (or looks like) them.

## Getting volunteers

I ended up deciding to a huge amount people! I got into the right mood for it and, bam, suddenly I’m placing an order for **80 cards**. It ended up being the whole team here, and my old workplace (back in Scotland).

> So… it wasn’t really volunteers to be exact.

But with the office here providing some quotes, I went to work on the design phase. And probably the toughest task of choosing a good image for everyone. I ended up using [Goodreads Quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes) to fill out the people who couldn’t come up with quotes themselves, and they had a great selection of them!

## Design and image choice

I decided not to go traditional Gwent style, and not just because I wanted something unique; I wanted to stick to **300 dpi for print**, and my art wasn’t high enough resolution to do full size at that resolution. And I had decided I wanted to do Tarot card sizing.

But, choosing images is the hardest part. Especially knowing some of the history of the characters, and not necessarily wanting to saddle someone with evil or distasteful characters.

> Except for one of the designers, he wears all black and got Eredin.

But of special note, the catalyst for this whole project was this image, is a gentleman named Ben. I found the art below while thinking idly about this project, it’d passed my mind before but with the lack of high res art I’d not considered it. When I showed Ben the initial card he was a little taken aback; this thing looked **shockingly like him**, and of course this was very much out of left field.

<div class="gallery galleryid-414 gallery-columns-1 gallery-size-medium" id="gallery-35"><figure class="gallery-item"><div class="gallery-icon portrait"> [![Piece of art showing a bald man talking his was out of trouble with some guards. Ben in life is well spoken and looks eerily like this!](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/98-jdAuIDC-209x300.png)](https://www.notyetexpired.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/98-jdAuIDC.png "Gwent Art for Ben") </div> <figcaption class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-35-429"> The resemblance is uncanny. </figcaption></figure></div>The rest sort of fell into place over the next few weeks. I don’t have a lot of time to do creative things, like videos for Yesterdays or projects like this, but I worked on this in the mornings before I went in to work. I’ve never done a print project before and after this I don’t think it’ll be me last (we’ll see how it turns out though)!

## The reveal

So the cards came in and without too much blathering on about them, they turned out wonderfully. Out of respect for my coworkers I’ve not shown their names, but seeing as you can simply look at my profile I have no problem showing you how my card turned out.

Also, I did opt for the **gold gilt edging**! Doubled the price of the deck, but well worth it.

I don’t work in an office of nerds or anything, and I don’t think most had seen trading cards in person since Pokemon (if at all). But universally appreciated, and I had a great time making them.

> **10/10** would make trading cards of my office again.

Also, I did a video on this!
