I’ll be releasing my first science fiction novel! When will it happen you ask? I hope to have it out before/at the start of summer.

It’s about a race of mechanical aliens called the ‘Machina’. They escape their dying universe into ours and crash land on Earth. How we, and they, handle the ensuring friction is the challenge for both races.

I’m working with an artist, Alex Child, to make the cover art, check out his [website](https://alexchildart.com/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/alexchld87/) if you’d like. I really like his art style and I thought it would fit beautifully for the novel.

In the coming months I want to put together some of my thoughts about the process of writing this novel, of world building and the thinking of all that. I’d love to highlight some of the things that changed when writing this, all hopefully for the better! Things that might inspire someone else to write their own stories, or to learn a little more about the Machina if they were curious.

I also intend to begin putting short / serialized stories on the blog. Something a little more manageable than a full on novel to write, edit and put out there for people to enjoy. Something that doesn’t take me **years** to publish.

More things to follow, but just an update. A way to say “something is happening” and all that.

Best wishes,  
Aaron
