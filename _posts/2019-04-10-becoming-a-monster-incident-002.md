## Wedding day

You smile. It’s your wedding day and you’re getting ready in your grandmother’s home. The house itself is exquisite: a modern architectural build attached to a 12th-century grey stone tower. The estate is equally stunning, sectioned into immaculately upkept gardens surrounded by a forest. Out of all the venues you looked at you’re delighted that your wedding could be held here, and you know your grand-maman is overjoyed to get to host it.

“Alright, you go get your shower done and those legs shaved.”

“I will, I will.” You shoo Pauline, your maid-of-honor, away. The door makes a silky-smooth click as it closes. It’s a nice bathroom: a clawfoot tub, a glass walled area with the showerhead high above it that makes it like showering in falling rain. Two sinks with enough room between them to have a dozen people put on their makeup. It’s the size of your entire dorm room from when you were at university.

You step into the shower, grasp the knobs, and turn it on. It’s one of those with a mechanism that more ‘normal’ people would struggle to use, and it makes you laugh a little. You leave your robe in a pile outside the massive glass doors.

You have short hair now, thankfully, so it’s easy to manage. After getting washed, you grab your razor.

> It’s a gaudy pink thing but it has about a million blades and “swivel technology”. It’ll do.

“God, it looks even thicker than normal.” The stubby hair looks dark and thick, like you haven’t shaved in weeks. The razer leaves pleasing little paths in the suds on your leg. Like the lines the lawn makes when the gardeners mow. Once the left leg is done you move onto your right.

All done. You get out of the shower and get a little lotion for your face and apply it, staring into your eyes in the mirror.

“Are you ready for this?” You break a smile and nod to your question. You are. You take a few pumps of the thicker lotion for your legs and rub it between your hands as you think about your wedding. They’d better have fixed the napkins, they had a dreadful pattern when you saw them yesterday. You start to put the lotion on, but your legs feel prickly already.

“Damn.” Your legs do look faintly stubby too. What the hell, that was a new razor! You stare angrily at your stubborn legs and their hair, they’ve always grown quickly but this doesn’t seem fair. It doesn’t seem normal. Grabbing a towel to wipe the extra lotion off your hands, the towel shreds as you pull it and there’s a sharp pain in all your fingers. There’s a flippy-floppy feeling in your gut; something isn’t right. You bring your hands up, strands of bloody towel on them, and see what looks like claws poking out the ends of your fingers.

You freeze, staring at those claws. All your hair seems to be thickening before your eyes, growing out of pores that aren’t there. Or shouldn’t be there. That weren’t there before. It’s sprouting up on your hands and, to your horror, on your stomach. You freeze again, not wanting to look up into the mirror to see what might be happening.

> Because right now it could just be in your head. It must be.

It must.

You feel your jaw pop forward like it’s been dislocated and you yelp in pain. It also makes you, compels you, to look. Your eyes snap up to the giant mirror. It doesn’t make sense to your brain. Your mouth and nose are jutting forward and thick hair–fur?– has sprouted all over your body and is growing into a silky matte.

A sudden pain in your backside and you twist around. A naked, disgusting tail of a rodent stretches out on the ground behind you. You feel a scream welling in your throat but it chokes before it comes out. You feel a pulsing, a stiffening of your muscles. You slip and the pain briefly pulls you into a crouch. But then you’re no longer in pain; you no longer have strange feelings. Nothing. You close your eyes and hear your breath pumping in your ears like a steam engine.

Rising slowly, you take a step back to the counter and look into the mirror. The face of what you could only describe as a humanoid rat looks back at you–rippling with muscles but with a tender, feminine look to it. You may have gone genuinely mad. That must be it. You’re imagining all this.

You don’t hear the smooth click of the bathroom door but you do hear the strange choking sound from the doorway. Spinning, you see your mother, eyes nearly bulging out of her head, frozen in fear. She has a lace veil gripped tightly in her hands. The ‘chk-chk’ sound continues from her throat. You take a wavering step towards her, trying to say something.

> A long, wavering squeak comes out instead.

She screams. It sends you into motion; some new set of instincts kicks in. Powerful legs carry you past her, out of the window, and onto the balcony. She falls back into the hallway, screaming as if her daughter had been murdered by a rat monster. Oblivious to the fact that her daughter *was* that rat monster.

Your grandmother’s estate stretches out before you. You think you can escape if you can only make it to the treeline. You know your spouse-never-to-be is just down the balcony from your room and you find yourself at the window. Heart hammering in your chest, you reach a claw to the window, pausing. Thinking.

“There it is!” You hear shouted from the ground, from one of the guards. Michael? Your rodent instincts kick in again and you run. Your uncle steps out ahead of you and you barrel into him, grabbing him with your now-powerful hands and throwing him back into the house with a screech. You hear the crash from behind you as he collides with something glass and you hope he isn’t hurt. Reaching the end of the balcony, you mount the railing and jump.

> Wow, you can jump.

The stable’s roof was probably thirty feet away and you easily clear the distance, landing roughly and tumbling somewhere past its edge. You scramble to your feet and run. The treeline is just ahead. There are more shouts behind you but you mercifully make the treeline, the evergreen trees stretching out before you.

You have a long day ahead of you before night falls, but your strange new legs don’t let you down.

You run.
