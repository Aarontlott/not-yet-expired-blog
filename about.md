## What is Not Yet Expired?

My hope is that Not Yet Expired is a place for stories of all shapes, sizes, and types. Written and visual. Creative projects and exercises that I couldn’t hope to fully dream up while writing a small description on a website.

But ideally they would all be worth sharing with you. I hope they’ll be entertaining, maybe challenging, and sometimes fun. My brother and I have always loved creating stories, growing up it was together, and now we (mostly) write.

**[Stories](https://www.notyetexpired.com/category/stories/)** is a place I want to tell, and talk about, stories. Written ones for now, but I hope to include some different mediums too.

[**Yesterdays Games**](https://www.notyetexpired.com/category/games/) is where I will talk about video game related things! Let’s Plays, reviews, and other things of interest.

## Who am I?

I’m a web developer by profession, with an wide varying interest in most things speculative fiction. I have lots of dreams, and this site is a first step in a direction to, perhaps, making some of those come true.

All in all, I hope you find something you like here.

Sincerely,
