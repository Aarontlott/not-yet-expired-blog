## Raiders

The merchant caravan is surrounded by the rest of your clan, and you run into the rocky hills with your other brothers towards their guard. He killed Kojo, your aunt’s son, and then scrambled out here. Kojo was able to disarm the average-sized looking man in their struggle, and you say to Manu,

“Surely he has run, and is even on the horizon now!”

“He would be stupid not to.”

You overheard your chief, Kwesi, as they have the caravan surrounded now, speaking with the merchants. Well, at least something they say catches your ear,

> “He is a skinwalker.”

You glance back, only a dozen paces away. The merchant looks scared and even he doesn’t seem to believe what he’s saying, “If you leave now, he will spare you.”

You feel like laughing, but Chief Kwesi doesn’t laugh and only shakes his head. That is enough for you. You turn and run quietly into the hills looking for their third guard.

It’s rocky, and hard to know where he’s gone. But you check for signs of his passing, and listen. Ebo, one of the older raiders, goes around a rock nearby and you hear the beginning of a cry and then nothing. You take your spear in hand and deftly work your way over and around the rock. You see Ebo’s body laying with his neck at a crazy angle many paces away, and then suddenly a hand is around your neck.

The guard looks of average build, but easily swats away your spear with one hand and you struggle ineffectually with his lone hand. The one crushing your throat. The guard glances up the hill, seeing no others and turns his face to you. It is plain, and emotionless.

> You think, **Surely a warrior feels something in battle?**

His face softens towards you.

“You’re younger than the rest. So much life ahead of you…” Things are beginning to fade, your vision darkening.

And then you’re gasping for breath, but still very much being held up by this guard. You stare into his eyes, looking for some reason there. His arms seem to hold impossible strength for their wiry look, and you feel a strong sense that all is not as it seems. As if something were writhing around under his skin, waiting to get out.

A skinwalker.

Or just your nerves? You ask,

“Why?”

He doesn’t answer directly,

> “Tell your chief to leave. If you try, if you do that as I ask, I will try to spare you.”

You stare into those plain eyes. Two of your fellow raiders drop down from the rock above you, spears driving into the guard, but his eyes don’t widen. His body reacts, or perhaps pretends to react, to the spears plunging into it. But before he falls, or lets himself fall down, he looks into your eyes for a moment longer.

The body lay there now on the brown dirt, bleeding.

“Brother, we have saved you. Let us go to the chief and tell them their skinwalker has died.”

You wipe your mouth and there’s blood there. You say,

“We should leave. He… it… it is not right.”

Manu says simply,

“Come.”

And they pull you down the hill, but your eyes return to the body. It doesn’t move. Every couple of paces you turn, and it is there.

He is dead. You have begun to shake. It still doesn’t feel right.

Nearly to the caravan and you look back.

The body is still there. His words echo in your ear, and as your hunting brothers gather with the tribe around the caravan, telling Kwesi of your victory, your own voice wavers out,

“Chief Kwesi, it is not right. We should go.”

You snap your head around to the hill. The body is still there.

“No, we take what is ours now.” And as Kwesi turns to the caravan, “Step aside, and we will take what is ours.”

There is some cursing from the merchants, and you turn, hopefully for the final time, to look on the hill. To see the body of the guard, who spared you.

> The body is now gone.

You catch a glimpse of something large behind a large outcrop of rock. It almost looked like an exposed bone from a massive animal. When it walks out from the rocks you see it and your mind crawls, you cannot move.

You cannot even speak; it is such a horrible, grotesque horror. A single exposed bone sticks up higher than the rest, out of the things spine, and a face holding rows and rows of horrible teeth stares out at you. And yet with those plain eyes, somehow. It’s twice the size of the biggest man you’ve ever seen, and its long arms end in wicked, curved claws. Your mind gibbers and threatens to break just trying to make sense of what you are seeing. It is a combination of exposed skin and bone, stretched over a massive body.

You make out what looks like part of the guard’s face on its shoulder, flapping gently in the wind.

The merchant’s woman begins to scream, but no one looks back. It is several of its paces away, having held your gaze as it approached, and it speaks in an unnatural voice. A voice straight out of the depths of the underworld and will haunt your every slumbering moment, should it keep its promise.

> “You tried, and so will I.”

Now they look, but the nightmare creature is in hideous motion now. You manage to turn, but rapidly wish you hadn’t been able to. The caravan wagon lurches into motion as the merchant screams in plain, stark madness. The lower half of one of your clan brothers, trailing his guts, flies over and the flailing leg kicks your chest. You scramble back in horror, wiping at the torrent of blood that splashed onto you.

They are all dead, and you remain. Your body seems to return to being yours, and you look around. There is nothing but the stink of death. The creature is gone. None of your clan remains alive, and the merchant is long gone. The guard is also not there. You spin and look to the surrounding hills.

There is nothing. You cry out, and the hills echo your primal scream back.

But there is nothing.

Yet with every beat of your heart, the image of the monster pulses in your vision.

> It has left you now, but it will never leave you.
