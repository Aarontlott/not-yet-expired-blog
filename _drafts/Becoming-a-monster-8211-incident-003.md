## The bathroom of a nightclub

The dull thump of music, of the bass anyhow, is pumped into the bathroom of this club. It’s just some song that could be any one of the popular electronic songs: some *wump wump*with a build up that’s followed by a drop to get everyone excited. You shake your head, fringe bobbing. It’s not really what you’re into but, hey, you’re out with the girls.

After carefully getting the toilet to flush by touching it as little as possible, you step into the dim, shitty light of the sink area. Perhaps it’s better that it isn’t well-lit. You crack a smile to yourself in the mirror. *It’s a great dress, not too short after all*. You hear the girl that came in after you throw up again. It sounds like she had a proper meal before this. You try not to groan audibly as you decide to offer help.

> “Are you okay?” You venture to the girl, but mostly speaking to the vacant stalls.

“Yeah.” She says, sounding tired, “Thanks.” You shrug; you did what you could. Suddenly, the room feels darker. Not by a lot, just by a little. And maybe that dinner before wasn’t sitting well with you because you feel a horrible turning in your stomach. Like when you’re hungry, or going to throw up. It’s the worst you’ve ever felt and the dress clinging to your body lets you see–actually see!–your stomach moving.

You feel unsteady on your heels–you don’t wear them often, after all–and there’s now pain radiating out from your stomach and into your extremities. *Oh my god, have I been spiked?* Things get a little darker; you falter on your heels again, grabbing for the counter.

You catch yourself, but several of your nails break off. There is shooting pain in that hand and you see flecks of blood on the ground. *FUCK fuck fuck*. Somehow you hold in a scream. That’s when it gets worse. You guide yourself unsteadily back to the darkest corner of the bathroom where the light is out. The other girl lets loose with another round of vomiting and somehow doesn’t hear you.

It feels like you’re coming out of your own skin. Because you are: you look down and there’s impossibly-scaly arms ending in wicked claws where your arms should be. And your legs seem to have fused. You flail a bit and fall, somehow quietly, into a puddle. There’s pain in your upper back now, too.

Again you manage not to scream. You rise up instinctually on your now-reptilian body, the tail of a massive snake out behind you. You hear the door open and, with a flash of fright, you remember you left your phone and your bag on the sink. You still have a lot of money for drinks in there. Shit. You hear what sounds like the lock spinning shut.

> You open your mouth to say, “*What the hell”* but only a low hiss comes out.

A man steps into the bathroom; he looks drunk but determined. *Was I spiked by this shitbag?* You feel a different instinct rise up in you drowning out your fear. A strong feeling of *not today asshole*. With a blink of your eyes you feel your scales change somehow and, looking down, you’re now invisible. The man begins to fumble with the girls stall door. Your gut flips.

She calls out, “Hey!” but you’re already in motion, slithering along the floor at lightning-speed. Well, maybe at a fast run. You blink again as you reach the stall; that blink somehow makes you visible again. The guy is struggling to get his pants down but pauses as he hears your approach. *You’ll never get the chance. Fuck you.*

You grab him with a strength you didn’t know you had. Well, that you didn’t have until just a few minutes ago. Your long, cruel claws easily pass through his skin and evoke a scream. *Way more useful than acrylics.* You drag him back, away from the girl who is screaming now. To quiet him, you bring him in close and you feel your mouth open impossibly wide as you tear into his neck and shoulder with knife-like teeth. Blood is everywhere. You give him a thrash, just for good measure, and cast his body aside. It’s easy. Not that you ever grabbed a steak in your mouth and shook it around, but it’s like that.

You hear a commotion outside the door–someone has noticed. *Fuck*. You look in the mirror, unable to really comprehend what you’re seeing. Some sort of snake monster is looking back at you, with a serpentine body and a flat-scaled head. Arms that ripple with strength. The head, your head, seems almost armored and covered in blood. You blink and you’re invisible again.

> The stall girl has fainted somewhere in all this. You grab your things and look at the door.

There’s no other escape. Seeing that your dress is still visible, you use a clawed hand to rip it off and throw it into the corner. A key turns in the door of the bathroom and, once it clangs open, you slither to just in front of the door. Two bouncers come in–their anger turning to horror when they see the body and all the blood. One vomits. Shit, this place is covered in vomit.

“Oh my God!!” The other shouts. With the one retching and the other falling back against the wall you take your chance.

You slither out the door and easily go up the stairs. Looking at the packed dance floor between you and the door, you consider your option. What else can you do? So you set off through the crowd.

People don’t really notice being bumped aside by something they can’t see. Some do, but you’re gone too quickly to see their reaction. By some crazy chance you pass Becky, the friend who convinced you to come. Pausing, you try to say sorry to her but a hiss comes out instead. She looks around, confused.

You make it to the front door and throw the bouncer out of your way and into the street in your haste. *This can’t be happening. It can’t be real.* But it feels real. You notice the cool ground under your scales. You’ve ruined a good dress. But you saved that girl.

You make your way into the dark with another angry hiss.
